# Image-Change-Detection-Algorithm
A Python and OpenCV-based change detection tool. It compares aligned "before" and "after" image pairs to identify missing or added objects. Using Gaussian blur, absolute difference, and contour detection, it automatically annotates changes with bounding boxes and saves the results.
